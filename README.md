Azure Arc Workbooks

This is a quick/dirty repo with Workbook(s) that I have produced for various scenarios

Details for Workbooks below as follows

1) ARC Workbook - uses PerfInsights Loq Query for monitoring/metric scenarios and Resource Graph Queries for Update Management Center (Patch Assessment Compliance and Machines missing passes, by category).  Some of the bells and whistles here are the ability to drill into resources (and particular views) based on native workbook capability.
